# Machine learning algorithms

Machine learning is a set of algorithms that enable a computer to learn by itself.

There are 3 categories of ML :
  - Supervised Learning
  - Unsupervised learning
  - Reinforcement learning

Let's see one by one these categories :

  ## Supervised learning
    - Regression models
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - KNN
    - Logistic Regression
  
  ## Unsupervised learning
    - Apriori Algorithm
    - K-Means
  
  ## Reinforcement learning
    - Markov Decision Process
